Based on out conversation, write up the requirements for this feature from system behavior perspective without delving into implementation details. 


### **Requirements for Notification Feature**

#### **Overview**
The notification feature is designed to provide users with alerts regarding important events within the system, including both user-specific events (e.g., dataset staging completion) and system-wide notifications (e.g., scheduled maintenance announcements). Users can opt-in to receive notifications for specific events and delivery methods while having the flexibility to opt-out of notifications for particular events.

#### **1. Notification Preferences**
- Users must have the ability to manage their notification preferences, allowing them to select preferred delivery methods (e.g., email, Slack, in-app notifications).
- Users can enable or disable notifications for each delivery method independently.
- Users may opt-out of notifications for specific events while still receiving other notifications.

#### **2. Event Types**
- The system must support various types of events that can trigger notifications, with each event type having a defined name, description, and associated notification message template.
- Admins should be able to define new event types and indicate whether an event is intended for system-wide notification.
  
#### **3. User Subscriptions**
- Users will automatically subscribe to notifications for specific events when they request actions that lead to those events (e.g., staging a dataset).
- Each subscription will be tied to a specific resource (e.g., dataset, project) to ensure relevant notifications are sent.
  
#### **4. System-Wide Notifications**
- The system must support sending notifications for events marked as system-wide, targeting all users regardless of their individual subscriptions.
- System-wide notifications must be sent using the preferred delivery methods selected by each user.
  
#### **5. Notification Sending Logic**
- Upon the occurrence of an event, the system must determine whether it is a user-specific event or a system-wide event.
- For user-specific events, the system must send notifications only to users who have opted in for that specific event and resource.
- For system-wide events, the system must send notifications to all users who have enabled notifications for any type of events.

#### **6. User Experience**
- Users should be able to view and manage their notification preferences easily through the user interface.
- Users should receive timely notifications through their chosen delivery methods, providing clear information about the events.
- Notifications should include relevant details, such as the type of event, affected resource, and any necessary follow-up actions.

#### **7. Administration and Management**
- Admins must have the ability to view and manage event types and templates used for notifications.
- Admins should be able to access logs or reports of notifications sent, including successful deliveries and any failures.

### **Conclusion**
This notification feature aims to enhance user engagement and ensure that users remain informed about relevant events in the system. By providing flexible subscription options and clear management of event notifications, the system can deliver timely and pertinent information to users effectively.
