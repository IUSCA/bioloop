# Celery-Based Workflow Execution Framework

## Overview

This document specifies the technical requirements, design guidelines, and architectural considerations for implementing a distributed task and workflow execution system using Celery. The system is intended to support robust, scalable, and observable execution of long-running and interdependent business processes.

## Objectives

* Ensure idempotent and stateless task execution
* Provide first-class support for workflow orchestration
* Enable fine-grained monitoring and control of tasks and workflows
* Support fault-tolerance and durability of execution
* Facilitate scalability and seamless code deployments

## Task Design

### Idempotency and Statelessness

* All tasks must be idempotent.
* Tasks should not retain internal state between executions.
* Side effects should be controlled and reversible or deduplicated.

### Business Logic Isolation

* Tasks must only contain business logic.
* Record-keeping, orchestration, and error handling should be externally managed via configuration.

### 3Metadata and Persistence

Each task must have a corresponding database record containing:

* Unique Task ID
* Input payload (and optional hash for deduplication)
* Timestamps: created\_at, started\_at, completed\_at
* Status: PENDING, RUNNING, SUCCESS, FAILED, CANCELLED
* Progress information (optional)
* Output or result
* Error message and stack trace

### Lifecycle and Control

* Tasks must define a hard timeout.
* Tasks must not fall into limbo states.
* Admins must be able to cancel (set state to CANCELLED) or retry tasks.
* Retries must support both automatic and manual modes.

### Scheduling and Execution

* Tasks must support:

  * ETA or scheduled execution
  * Queue routing based on task characteristics
  * Concurrency and rate limits

### Monitoring and Observability

* Celery events and task metadata should be used for monitoring.
* Provide APIs/UI for task status inspection and lifecycle control.

## Workflow Design

### Structure and Execution Semantics

* Workflows are modeled as a sequence of tasks.
* Chains (linear sequences) and complex DAGs must be supported.

### Workflow as First-Class Entity

* Each workflow must have a database record containing:

  * Workflow ID and metadata
  * Task graph definition (including dependencies)
  * Workflow status: PENDING, RUNNING, SUCCESS, FAILED, CANCELLED
  * Task progress overview ex: 3/5 tasks completed

* **Task Priority Support**
    * Assign a priority level to each task within a workflow.
    * Later tasks in a workflow should be given higher priority than earlier tasks.
    * This enables Celery to process all tasks of a workflow consecutively, improving workflow completion efficiencyâ€”especially when multiple workflows are queued and multiple workers are available.
    * Without task-level priority differentiation, workers may process the first task of each workflow before proceeding, resulting in longer workflow durations.
    * By leveraging task priorities, workers can execute tasks in priority order, ensuring faster and more efficient workflow execution.

### Monitoring and Control

* Expose APIs/UI for:

  * Start, pause, cancel, resume
  * Retry failed workflows
* Support implicit task-level timeouts

### Retry Semantics

* Retrying a workflow must re-execute failed/canceled tasks and downstream dependencies.
* Resumption must be possible from the point of failure.

## Fault Tolerance

### Task Durability

* Tasks must be persisted before execution.
* Task queues must be durable.

### Worker Reliability

* Tasks must be retryable if a worker crashes.
* Use Celery settings: `acks_late`, `visibility_timeout`, etc.
* Long-running tasks must be resumable by any healthy worker.

## Scalability

### Worker Configuration

* Workers should:

  * Run multiple processes or threads
  * Be deployable across multiple machines
  * Support multiple execution pools (prefork, eventlet, etc.)

### Queue Management

* Tasks must be routed to queues based on:

  * Task type
  * Priority
  * SLA or latency requirements

## Deployment Strategy

### Rolling Deployments

* Implement graceful shutdown protocol:

  * On signal, worker should stop accepting new tasks
  * Finish current tasks and shut down cleanly
* Start new worker with updated code in parallel
* Use consistent task acknowledgment and result backend to avoid duplication
