Requirements and Limitations <a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-requirements-and-limitations" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;2. Requirements and Limitations&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Authorized users should be able to upload files directly from their web browsers. The uploaded files should be protected from unauthorized users who have access to Slate-Scratch.</p><p>Network timeouts, data corruption and other problems that arise from uploading large files must be avoided. To achieve this, our file upload architecture uploads files in chunks of 2 MB. Uploading files in chunks also gives us a more granular view into the upload state.</p><p>Since our workers run on Colo nodes, it is convenient to upload files to Colo nodes, so they can be processed by workers, instead of uploading files to the main API server, and then transferring them to Colo nodes.</p><h2 id="_3-architecture-overview" tabindex="-1">3.

These worker run on Colo nodes.</li><li>Signet: An OAuth server supporting client credential flow with the appropriate scope for uploading files to create secure tokens.</li><li>File Upload Server (Nginx): A server on the worker node which receives requests from users to upload files. Files are uploaded to this server, in chunks.</li><li>Secure Upload API: A lightweight app hosted on the File Upload Server that validates the incoming requests (i.e. checking for the appropriate scope) to the file upload API.</li></ul><h2 id="_4-the-upload" tabindex="-1">4.
