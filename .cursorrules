# Bioloop Project Rules for AI Agents

Before working on this project, please read the AI_MEMORY.md file in the project root to understand:
- Project overview and architecture
- Authentication & authorization patterns
- API design conventions
- UI/UX patterns
- Component structure
- Database & API patterns
- Security considerations
- Worker development conventions

This is a microservice architecture with separate UI, API, and Worker components. Always consider the impact of changes across all services.

Key patterns to remember:
- Use `auth.canAdmin` and `auth.canOperate` instead of `auth.hasRole(['admin', 'operator'])`
- User-specific endpoints use `/:username` pattern with `checkOwnership: true`
- Use transactions for data consistency
- Page components should be minimal, delegating to list components
- Use icons instead of buttons for actions
- Always check permissions before allowing operations
